      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;This is our final Networking paper during my master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Information Security (InfoSec). The topic and initial router configurations were presented by my group mate, E.C. However, I had to make some changes to the provided router configurations and network architecture to remediate the issues we faced in the lab. I deployed the lab environment and revised router configuration using GNS3, then wrote our report paper, which you see below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
